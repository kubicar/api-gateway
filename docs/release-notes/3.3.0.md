## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed a bug where APIRules `v2alpha1` and `v2` were set to the `Error` state when the target workload was in the mesh with the Istio proxy running in native sidecar mode. See [#2100](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2100).
- The APIRule CR's status is now correctly updated when **spec.gateway** uses the old legacy format. See [#2067](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2067).
