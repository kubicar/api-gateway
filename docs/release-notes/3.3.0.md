## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed a bug where APIRules `v2alpha1` and `v2` were set to the `Error` state when the target workload was in the mesh with the Istio proxy running in native sidecar mode. See [#2100](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2100).
- We've fixed a bug where for APIRule CR `spec.gateway` in old legacy format can cause issue with not updated status of APIRule. See [#2067](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2067).
